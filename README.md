DUSTED A Record Collections App by Evan Morgan.

For this project, I wanted to make an easy to use app for record collectors to keep track of thier collections
for easy organization.

FEATURES:

Using Google Authorization, users can log into their accounts and have access to the homescreen to start their collection
